    "### 1.3 Steps of the HHL algorithm\n",

    "- The register $ n_l $ contains the phase approximation of the eigenvalues of $ e ^ {iAt} $ after execution of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm, the size of this register is a parameter of the algorithm that we will discuss during phases of numerical experiments of the algorithm.\n",

    "- The register $ n_b $ is used to record the state $ \\ket{b} $, in practice if the matrix is of size $ 2 ^ n $, the size of this register will be $ n $.

The first $ 4n_l $ qubits are used to invert the estimated relative phase after QPE and the last qubit is used as a flag variable for the success of one run of the HHL algorithm. In many articles only the last qubit is considered but in practice this is not the case as we can see in this implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will note $ n_l = a $ to say that the register $ n_l $ is of size equal to $ a $ and likewise the other registers. Having said this, the steps of the HHL algorithm are:\n",

    "**1) Loading data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the quantum state of the complete system is $\\ket{0}_{n_S}\\ket{0}_{n_l}\\ket{0}_{n_b}$. Since we can standardize the system to be solved, we can assume that $\\| b \\|=1$. Using the so-called qRAM loading algorithm, the state of the registers is transformed as follows:\n",

More precisely, by noting $e^{i\\lambda_j t} = e^{i 2 \\pi \\theta_j}$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\cdots 2^{n_l} \\}$, we want to estimate the relative phases $\\theta_j$.

The decomposition is found using a greedy algorithm and coloring approach with a classical time complexity of $\\mathcal{O} \\left( Ns^2 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_H} \\right)$ where N is the number of rows / columns of matrix A, $ s $ its sparsity and $ epsilon_H $ the allowed error in the approximation of $ U $ by $\\tilde {U}$.\n",

However, this brings up two problems. The first, of a mathematical nature, is that if $\\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\theta_j}}$ is strictly greater than 1, then this quantity cannot by definition be an amplitude of probability.

In this operator the $\\ket{i}_{S}\\ket{j}_{S'} = \\ket{2i+j}_{n_S}$ for $i,j$ already in binary, so $\\ket{0}_{n_S} = \\ket{0}_S \\ket{0}_{S'}$.\n",

In other words, this operator performs the Euclidean division between $C$ and $\\tilde{\\theta_j}$. Notice that all the sub-registers in this sub-step are of size $n_l$ and they constitute the register $S'$.
